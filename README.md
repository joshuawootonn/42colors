Couple of years ago I was working on a site called [42 colors](https://github.com/joshuawootonn/42colors-v0). I don't know why I abandoned the idea honestly. I was hosting it on azure so I took it down at some point. 

It's back. With a vengeance. 

The idea is MSPaint + Minecraft server style land chartering & biomes. 

1. you get a charter for small plot of land
2. you find a spot in a biome you like
3. you draw something cool
4. if people like it you get a charter for another plot of land
